# This program prints bad apple video on my cpu

This program uses [ASCII version of bad apple](https://github.com/Chion82/ASCII_bad_apple) with little changes. It requires asm and cpu version 0.3.3 but it may also  work with the later ones.

## Running

You have to compaile and run `generator.cpp` to create `badapple.casm` file which you should compile with `asm` and run `badapple.boac` from cpu.
