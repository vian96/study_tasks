    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
    A greater power than we can contradict
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
    A lightning before death. O, how may I
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A public place.

  Abram, servant to Montague.
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
    Afore me, It is so very very late
    After the prompter, for our entrance;
    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
    All our whole city is much bound to him.
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    All this I know, and to the marriage
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
  An Apothecary.
    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
  An Officer.
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    'An if a man did need a poison now
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
  An old Man, of the Capulet family.
                   An old hare hoar,
    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
    And I am proof against their enmity.
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
    And I'll believe thee.
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And all the better is it for the maid.
    And all things change them to the contrary.
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
                   And an old hare hoar,
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
    And he shall signify from time to time
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
    And his to me,
    And hither shall he come; and he and I
    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    And makes himself an artificial night.
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    And never from this palace of dim night
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.
    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
    And presently took post to tell it you.
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
    And see how he will take it at your hands.
    And see how one another lends content;
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    And since that time it is eleven years,
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    And soar with them above a common bound.
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    And soundly too. Your houses!
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    And that my master slew him.
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
    And that we have a curse in having her.
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
    And then I ran away to call the watch.
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    And then down falls again.
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    And then will I be general of your woes
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
    And thou art wedded to calamity.
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
    And where the worser is predominant,
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    And with my child my joys are buried!
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
    And yet I would it were to give again.
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    Anthony, and Potpan!
  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
  Apoth. Who calls so loud?
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Are made already mothers. By my count,
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
    As is the night before some festival
    As living here and you no use of him.
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Attendants.
    Away from light steals home my heavy son
    Away to heaven respective lenity,
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
  Bal. Full half an hour.
  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
  Bal. I dare not, sir.
  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
  Bal. Romeo.
  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
  Balthasar, servant to Romeo.
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    Because it is an enemy to thee.
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
    Being one too many by my weary self-
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
  Ben. And what to?
  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
  Ben. But new struck nine.
  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
  Ben. For what, I pray thee?
  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
  Ben. Groan? Why, no;
  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
  Ben. In love?
  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
  Ben. Of love?
  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
  Ben. Romeo will answer it.
  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
  Ben. Stop there, stop there!
  Ben. Strike, drum.
  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
  Ben. The what?
  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
  Ben. What, art thou hurt?
  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
  Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    Black and portentous must this humour prove
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
    But 'tis no wit to go.
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    But O, it presses to my memory
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    But Romeo may not. More validity,
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
                   But a hare that is hoar
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    But come, young waverer, come go with me.
    But every man betake him to his legs.
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    But he that hath the steerage of my course
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    But not another sin upon my head
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    But sadly tell me who.
    But send him back.
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]
    But to the earth some special good doth give;
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
    But, as it seems
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    But, let them measure us by what they will,
    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
    But, soft! what day is this?
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    By having him making yourself no less.
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
    Call, good Mercutio.
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Came he not home to-night?
    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    Can I demand.
    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.

  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,

  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,

  Cap. Go, begone.
  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
  Cap. He shall be endur'd.
  Cap. How canst thou try them so?
  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
  Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;

    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.

    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?

    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack

    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
    Farewell, dear father.
    Farewell, my coz.
    Farewell.
    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    For I have need of many orisons
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    For fair without the fair within to hide.
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    For here we need it not.
    For in a minute there are many days.
    For it excels your first; or if it did not,
    For it was bad enough before their spite.
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.

    For nothing can be ill if she be well.

    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    For this night's watching.
    For this time all the rest depart away.
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]

  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
  Friar. Benedicite!
  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
  Friar. Go with me to the vault.
  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
  Friar. How long hath he been there?
  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest

  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

  Friar. Not in a grave
  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
  Friar. O woeful sympathy!
  Friar. O, she knew well
  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
  Friar. Romeo!
  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
  Friar. That's a certain text.
  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
  Friar. Too familiar
  Friar. Welcome then.
  Friar. Who is it?
  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
    Give me a case to put my visage in.
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
God.
    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
    Good night.

  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!

    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
    Have you delivered to her our decree?
    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
                                                  He goeth down.
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
                                     He walks by them and sings.
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?

    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,

    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    How shall that faith return again to earth
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    How stands your disposition to be married?
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
    I come from Lady Juliet.
    I conjure only but to raise up him.
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
    I do beseech thee-
    I do remember an apothecary,
    I do remember well where I should be,
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
    I have more care to stay than will to go.
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
    I hear him near.
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    I promise you, but for your company,
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
    I think it best you married with the County.
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
    I will omit no opportunity
    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
    I would adventure for such merchandise.
    I would have been abed an hour ago.
    I would not for the wealth of all this town
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!
    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
    I'll not endure him.
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
    I'll to my rest.
    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
    I- measuring his affections by my own,
    If I departed not and left him there.
    If I did stay to look on his intents.
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
    If, rather than to marry County Paris
    Immediately we do exile him hence.
    In all her best array bear her to church;
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    In such a gorgeous palace!
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    In this so sudden business.
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    In what I farther shall intend to do,
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    Is but a little way above our heads,
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
    Is death to any he that utters them.
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
    Is he gone and hath nothing?
    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
                   Is too much for a score
                Is very good meat in Lent;
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    It burneth in the Capels' monument.
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    It rains downright.
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
  Jul. Amen!
  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
  Jul. Ay me!
  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  Jul. Do not swear at all;
  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
  Jul. How now? Who calls?
  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
  Jul. I have.
  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Jul. Madam, I am here.
  Jul. Madam, I am not well.
  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
  Jul. Nurse?
  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
  Jul. Romeo!
  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
  Jul. Sweet, so would I.
  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
  Jul. What must be shall be.
  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
  Jul. What villain, madam?
  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
  Jul. You kiss by th' book.
  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
                                                   Juliet rises.
Juliet's chamber.
Juliet's chamber.
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
  Juliet, daughter to Capulet.
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
    Juliet, the County stays.
    Just in her case!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
                                                 Knock [within].
  Lady Capulet, wife to Capulet.
  Lady Montague, wife to Montague.
  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
  Lady. That same villain Romeo.
  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
  Lady. You are too hot.
  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
                                             Lays down a dagger.
                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    Life and these lips have long been separated.
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    Like softest music to attending ears!
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
      Lucio and the lively Helena.'
  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    Making them women of good carriage.
  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
  Man. No, my good lord.
  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Mantua. A street.
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
    Maskers, Torchbearers, Pages, Guards, Watchmen, Servants, and
    May be put from her by society.
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
  Mer. A challenge, on my life.
  Mer. A sail, a sail!
  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
  Mer. And but one word with one of us?
  Mer. And so did I.
  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
  Mer. By my heel, I care not.
  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
  Mer. He is wise,
  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
  Mer. I am hurt.
  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
  Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
  Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
  Mer. Right.
  Mer. That dreamers often lie.
  Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
  Mer. Why, may one ask?
  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
  Mercutio, kinsman to the Prince and friend to Romeo.
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
  Mon. But I can give thee more;
  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
  Montague, heads of two houses at variance with each other.
    Montagues.
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    Most lamentable day, most woful day
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
  Mother. Good night.
  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
  Mother. O woful time!
  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
  Mother. What is the matter?
  Mother. What noise is here?
  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
                                    Music plays, and they dance.
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
    My life were better ended by their hate
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
    My will to her consent is but a part.
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Nell.
    Never was seen so black a day as this.
    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
    None but for some, and yet all different.
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
  Nurse to Juliet.
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
    Nurse!- What should she do here?
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
  Nurse. Anon, anon!
  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Nurse. Even so lies she,
  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
  Nurse. I know not.
  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
  Nurse. I speak no treason.
  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
  Nurse. Is it good-den?
  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
  Nurse. Madam!
  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
  Nurse. May not one speak?
  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
  Nurse. My fan, Peter.
  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
  Nurse. Peter!
  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
  Nurse. Romeo can,
  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
  Nurse. There's no trust,
  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
  Nurse. What's this? what's this?
  Nurse. What?
  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
  Nurse. You say well.
  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
  Nurse. Your mother.
  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
                                           [Nurse] calls within.
    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    O anything, of nothing first create!
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
    O cousin, cousin!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    O son, the night before thy wedding day
    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    O that she knew she were!
    O weraday that ever I was born!
    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
    O woful day! O woful day!
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
    Of disobedient opposition
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    Of one I danc'd withal.
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    On Thursday next be married to this County.
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    One of our order, to associate me
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    One that you love.
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Or manage it to part these men with me.
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Or never after look me in the face.
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass
    Or shall we on without apology?
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
    Or, if I live, is it not very like
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
    Out on her, hilding!
    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
PROLOGUE
  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
  Par. Monday, my lord.
  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
  Paris, a young Count, kinsman to the Prince.
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
  Pet. You will not then?
  Peter, servant to Juliet's nurse.
  Peter. Anon.
  Peter. Anon.
  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
    Piteous predicament!
    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
  Prince. And for that offence
  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    Receive in either by this dear encounter.
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
  Rom. 'Tis the way
  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
  Rom. (rises) Nurse-
  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
  Rom. A most courteous exposition.
  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
  Rom. As if that name,
  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
  Rom. Bid her devise
  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
  Rom. By a name
  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
  Rom. By the hour of nine.
  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
  Rom. Farewell!
  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
  Rom. For your broken shin.
  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
  Rom. Good heart, at what?
  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
  Rom. Good morrow, father.
  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  Rom. Here's goodly gear!
  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
  Rom. I thought all for the best.
  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
  Rom. I will follow you.
  Rom. I would I were thy bird.
  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
  Rom. If my heart's dear love-
  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
  Rom. Is the day so young?
  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
  Rom. My dear?
  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
  Rom. Nay, that's not so.
  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
  Rom. Out-
  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
  Rom. Pink for flower.
  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
  Rom. She speaks.
  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
  Rom. So thrive my soul-
  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
  Rom. This shall determine that.
  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
  Rom. Well, what was yours?
  Rom. What hast thou found?
  Rom. What is her mother?
  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
  Rom. What shall I swear by?
  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
  Rom. Whither?
  Rom. Whose house?
  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    Romeo is coming.
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
    Romeo!
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
  Romeo, son to Montague.
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
                            SCENE.--Verona; Mantua.
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
  Samp. Fear me not.
  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
  Samp. Well, sir.
  Samp. Yes, better, sir.
  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
  Sampson, servant to Capulet.
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.

    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
  Serv. I know not, sir.
  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
  Serv. My master's.
  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
  Serv. To supper, to our house.
  Serv. Up.
  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
Servingmen come forth with napkins.
    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
    Shall I send to thee?
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
    Shall have the chinks.
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
    Shalt with him hence.
    Shame come to Romeo!
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
    She could have run and waddled all about;
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    She's not well married that lives married long,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    So early walking did I see your son.
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    So fearful were they of infection.
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
    So stumblest on my counsel?
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
    Some comfort, nurse.
    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    Some misadventure.
    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    Spare not for cost.
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
    Staying for thine to keep him company.
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
THE END
THE END
                        THE PROLOGUE
    Take all myself.
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    Take it in what sense thou wilt.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    That God had lent us but this only child;
That I
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    That I might touch that cheek!
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    That I yet know not?
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
    That all the world will be in love with night
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    That calls our person from our morning rest?
    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
    That we may call it early by-and-by.
    That were some spite; my invocation
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    That whiles Verona by that name is known,
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
    The County Paris hath set up his rest
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    The County will be here with music straight,
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
    The life of Tybalt.
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    The most you sought was her promotion,
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    The only son of your great enemy.
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    The other did not so.
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
    The unreasonable fury of a beast.
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
    Then dreams he of another benefice.
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
           'Then music with her silver sound
           Then music with her silver sound'-
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
    These dead men's tombs.
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    They are free men, but I am banished.
                                                     They fight.
                                                     They fight.
                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.
                                                   [They fight.]
    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]
    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    This but begins the woe others must end.
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
    This is she-
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    This night you shall behold him at our feast.
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    Thou talk'st of nothing.
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  Three Musicians.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
                                             [Throws them down.]
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    Thy lips are warm!
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    'Tis now near night.
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
    To Lammastide?
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
    To bid me trudge.
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!

    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    What further woe conspires against mine age?
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?

    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Which craves as desperate an execution
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
    Which is as thin of substance as the air,
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,

    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,

    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.

    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe

    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?

    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,

  Escalus, Prince of Verona.
    With all the admired beauties of Verona.
                            SCENE.--Verona; Mantua.
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    For so he said he would.                         Play music.
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Warm and new kill'd.
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
  Cap. He shall be endur'd.
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
    To make confession and to be absolv'd.
  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    Young son, it argues a distempered head
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
    But not another sin upon my head
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
    narrow to an ell broad!
  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    They are free men, but I am banished.
  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
    How stands your disposition to be married?
    And with my child my joys are buried!
    Who here hath lain this two days buried.
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    being dared.
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
    Life and these lips have long been separated.
  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
    moved.
  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    And all the better is it for the maid.
    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    'A was a merry man) took up the child.
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
    Maskers, Torchbearers, Pages, Guards, Watchmen, Servants, and
    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    Can I demand.
  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
    This but begins the woe others must end.
  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
    To-morrow will I send.
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    We sucking on her natural bosom find;
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    And soar with them above a common bound.
    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
    'To seek him here that means not to be found.
    Which then most sought where most might not be found,
  Rom. What hast thou found?
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
           Then music with her silver sound'-
           'Then music with her silver sound
    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
God.
    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
Capulet's orchard.
Capulet's orchard.
Capulet's orchard.
Capulet's orchard.
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
  Rom. I would I were thy bird.
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Man. No, my good lord.
    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
  Par. Monday, my lord.
  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
  Apoth. Who calls so loud?
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
Dramatis Personae
    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
    I do remember well where I should be,
  Jul. What must be shall be.
    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    Or never after look me in the face.
  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
    You tallow-face!
    In such a gorgeous palace!
A public place.
Verona. A public place.
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Together with the terror of the place-
    Either withdraw unto some private place
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    Then dreams he of another benefice.
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
                                    Music plays, and they dance.
    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
    After the prompter, for our entrance;
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
  Prince. And for that offence
    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    Immediately we do exile him hence.
    Shalt with him hence.
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
                      Enter Friar Laurence.
Enter Friar [Laurence].
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
  Paris, a young Count, kinsman to the Prince.
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
    For fair without the fair within to hide.
  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    law on my side.
  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
    To Lammastide?
    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
    thee-
  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
    And I'll believe thee.
  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    I do beseech thee-
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
    Shall I send to thee?
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Because it is an enemy to thee.
  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
  Ben. For what, I pray thee?
    Have you delivered to her our decree?
                        two or three.
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
    you read anything you see?
                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
  Mer. A challenge, on my life.
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
    What further woe conspires against mine age?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
    To bid me trudge.
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she

    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
    quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the

    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
    And the rank poison of the old will die.
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
  Mer. That dreamers often lie.
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
  Abr. You lie.

    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    One of our order, to associate me

  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    with me.
    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
    Or manage it to part these men with me.
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
    But come, young waverer, come go with me.
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,

    And his to me,
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
  Jul. Ay me!
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
  Rom. By a name
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
  Rom. As if that name,
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time

    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
    come?
  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    What, have you din'd at home?
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
  Rom. By the hour of nine.
  Ben. But new struck nine.
    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
    For who is living, if those two are gone?
    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
  Cap. Go, begone.
  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
Enter Romeo alone.
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Enter Juliet alone.
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
    For never was a story of more woe
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
  Jul. Madam, I am here.
  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
    Nurse!- What should she do here?
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Every good hap to you that chances here.
  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
  Mother. What noise is here?
  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
    If I departed not and left him there.
  Friar. How long hath he been there?
  Ben. Stop there, stop there!
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    O that she knew she were!
    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
                   Is too much for a score
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
  Mon. But I can give thee more;
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    Some misadventure.
  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case!
    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.
  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
  Rom. Bid her devise
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
  Mer. He is wise,
    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
    there for the goose.
    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    of that name, for fault of a worse.
  Rom. (rises) Nurse-
  Jul. Nurse?
Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
Enter Juliet and Nurse.
                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.
                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
                       Enter Nurse.
                          Enter Nurse.
                              Enter Nurse.
[Enter Nurse.]
    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
    Some comfort, nurse.
  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
  Peter, servant to Juliet's nurse.
  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
    But he that hath the steerage of my course
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    As I remember, this should be the house.
Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
    Her mother is the lady of the house.
  Rom. Whose house?
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
  Serv. To supper, to our house.
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Capulet's house.
Capulet's house.
Capulet's house.
Capulet's house
Capulet's house.
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    O anything, of nothing first create!
  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    My life were better ended by their hate
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
    Afore me, It is so very very late
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
  Friar. Benedicite!
  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    A villain, that is hither come in spite
    For it was bad enough before their spite.
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
  Lady Montague, wife to Montague.
  Romeo, son to Montague.
  Abram, servant to Montague.
  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Jul. I have.
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
    To lay one in, another out to have.
  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
  Friar. Not in a grave
    To press before thy father to a grave?
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
    But to the earth some special good doth give;
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
                       Enter Juliet above.
                     Enter Juliet again, [above].
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
  Ben. Of love?
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
  Ben. In love?
  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
  Rom. If my heart's dear love-
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    One that you love.
  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
    Black and portentous must this humour prove
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Being one too many by my weary self-
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
    Take all myself.
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    Out on her, hilding!
    gold for sounding.
    For this night's watching.
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
    Thou talk'st of nothing.
    Is he gone and hath nothing?
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
    tutor me from quarrelling!
    What say you, Simon Catling?
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
    Romeo is coming.
    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
    She's not well married that lives married long,
  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    But she's best married that dies married young.
  Rom. Is the day so young?
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
    In all her best array bear her to church;
                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
    And then I ran away to call the watch.
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    But now I see this one is one too much,
  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Dost thou not laugh?
  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
    am a pretty piece of flesh.
    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    How shall that faith return again to earth
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
    Even now the frozen bosom of the North
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
  Nurse. May not one speak?
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
    But send him back.
    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
    That I might touch that cheek!
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
  Jul. You kiss by th' book.
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
  Mer. Why, may one ask?
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    Were in a mask?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Of one I danc'd withal.
    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
    Come, vial.
    Turn from their office to black funeral-
  Cap. All things that we ordained festival
    As is the night before some festival
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
    When well apparell'd April on the heel
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
     minstrel.
    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
    So stumblest on my counsel?
  Mer. A sail, a sail!
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
  Jul. Do not swear at all;
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.

  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Nell.
  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
    Unto my cell.
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
    For nothing can be ill if she be well.
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
  Jul. Madam, I am not well.
  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  Friar. O, she knew well
  Nurse. You say well.
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    Farewell.
  Rom. Farewell!
  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
    What is your will?
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
    But, let them measure us by what they will,
  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
    What said my man when my betossed soul
  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
  Rom. So thrive my soul-
    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. Madam!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
  Jul. What villain, madam?
    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Is death to any he that utters them.
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
    I'll not endure him.
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
    As living here and you no use of him.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
    All our whole city is much bound to him.
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    I conjure only but to raise up him.
  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    And that my master slew him.
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
    Thy lips are warm!
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm

    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
    Your worship in that sense may call him man.
    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,

    O, he's a lovely gentleman!

  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    Anthony, and Potpan!
  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
  Nurse. Is it good-den?
    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen

    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
  Wife. She's not fourteen.
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
  Friar. Welcome then.
  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
  Pet. You will not then?
    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
  Jul. Amen!
  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
    master's kinsmen.
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    With instruments upon them fit to open
  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.

    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
    And yet I would it were to give again.
    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
    And then down falls again.
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;

    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
  Rom. For your broken shin.
  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
                                           [Nurse] calls within.
                                                 Knock [within].
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    O cousin, cousin!
  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?

    That were some spite; my invocation
  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    So fearful were they of infection.
    Of disobedient opposition

  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    So early walking did I see your son.

    Away from light steals home my heavy son
  Nurse. I speak no treason.

    O weraday that ever I was born!
    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.

  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
  Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo
  Mercutio, kinsman to the Prince and friend to Romeo.
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    Shame come to Romeo!
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
  Balthasar, servant to Romeo.
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Enter Romeo.
Enter Romeo.
                       Enter Romeo.

                         Enter Romeo.
                               Enter Romeo.
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
                                                     Exit Romeo.
  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
    Come, shall we go?
    I have more care to stay than will to go.
    But 'tis no wit to go.
    I would have been abed an hour ago.
    His son was but a ward two years ago.
  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
    But sadly tell me who.
  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
                      Enter Benvolio.
                        Enter Benvolio.
                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].
  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
    Call, good Mercutio.
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
  Ben. Groan? Why, no;
    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
  Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
  Cap. How canst thou try them so?
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    The other did not so.
    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
  Rom. Nay, that's not so.
  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
  Cap. Go to, go to!
  Ben. And what to?
  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
    the two.
    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
  Serv. Up.
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    Help, help! Call help.
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
  Rom. My dear?
  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
  Rom. Here's goodly gear!
    I hear him near.
    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
  Friar. Too familiar
                                                   Exit [Friar].
    What if it be a poison which the friar
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
                   An old hare hoar,
                   And an old hare hoar,
                   But a hare that is hoar
    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
                                               Exit [Balthasar].
  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
Juliet's chamber.
Juliet's chamber.
    sought for, in the great chamber.
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
  An Officer.
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
                                             Lays down a dagger.
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    occupy the argument no longer.
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
    And that we have a curse in having her.
  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
                            Enter Father.
  Rom. Good morrow, father.
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    Farewell, dear father.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
  Rom. Whither?
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
  Montague, heads of two houses at variance with each other.
  Capulet, heads of two houses at variance with each other.
                       Enter Mother.
                          Enter Mother.
                           Enter Mother.
  Rom. What is her mother?
  Nurse. Your mother.
    is your mother?
    "Where is your mother?"'
  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    mourners, and stay dinner.
    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
  Nurse. My fan, Peter.
  Nurse. Peter!
  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].
                         Enter Peter.
                                                   [Exit Peter.]
                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
    Receive in either by this dear encounter.
    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.
  Mother. What is the matter?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
  Abr. No better.
    with a letter?
  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
  2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
    Within the infant rind of this small flower
  Rom. Pink for flower.
  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    Which is as thin of substance as the air,
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    To merit bliss by making me despair.
    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
    thumb, sir.
  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
  Samp. Well, sir.
  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
  2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
  Samp. Yes, better, sir.
  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
  Bal. I dare not, sir.
  Serv. I know not, sir.
  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
    Which you weep for.
    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
  Bal. Full half an hour.
  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
  Serv. My master's.
  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
    These dead men's tombs.
    their heads.
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
    Is but a little way above our heads,
  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
  Greg. The heads of the maids?
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And see how he will take it at your hands.
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Cold death aside and with the other sends
  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
                Enter Nurse, with cords.
  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies.
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    Examine other beauties.
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
                                  Exeunt omnes.
                                                   Exeunt omnes.
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    bench? O, their bones, their bones!
    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
    And then will I be general of your woes
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
                                                   Juliet rises.
    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
  Citizens of Verona; Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of both houses;
    And soundly too. Your houses!
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Montagues.
  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
    But every man betake him to his legs.
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
                                     He walks by them and sings.
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
      logs.
  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
  Nurse. What's this? what's this?
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
    Never was seen so black a day as this.
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
    But, soft! what day is this?
  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
    Forgetting any other home but this.
  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    If, rather than to marry County Paris
  Rom. She speaks.
    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    Shall have the chinks.
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
  Jul. How now? Who calls?
                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]
                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.
  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
    man to bow in the hams.
    But, as it seems
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
  Three Musicians.
  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
                          partisans.
                      Enter Citizens.
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]
        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
Servingmen come forth with napkins.
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    For I have need of many orisons
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Like softest music to attending ears!
  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Environed with all these hideous fears,
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
    To stop the inundation of her tears,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
    And since that time it is eleven years,
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    lick their fingers.
                       Enter Tybalt and others.
               Enter Montague [and others].
            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
                     and [others].
  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Torchbearers.
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
                                           [with his Followers].
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
  Rom. Well, what was yours?
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    By having him making yourself no less.
  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
    In this so sudden business.
    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    Attendants.
              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
    If I did stay to look on his intents.
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  1. Mus. What will you give us?
  Mer. And but one word with one of us?
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
  Chorus.
Enter Chorus.
                        Enter Chorus.
  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
    For you and I are past our dancing days.
    For in a minute there are many days.
  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
    Juliet, the County stays.
  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
  Nurse. What?
  Cap. Will you tell me that?
  Rom. This shall determine that.
    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
    What says he of our marriage? What of that?
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
  Ben. The what?
  Rom. Good heart, at what?
  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A Street.
A street.
A street.
Mantua. A street.
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

    I come from Lady Juliet.
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'
Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
                       Enter Old Capulet.
  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
of Capulet.
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
  Lady Capulet, wife to Capulet.
  Juliet, daughter to Capulet.
  Sampson, servant to Capulet.
  Gregory, servant to Capulet.
  Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet.
  Tybalt, nephew to Lady Capulet.
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
    Without a sudden calm will overset
    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
  Mer. Right.
    The County will be here with music straight,
    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
    follow straight.
                                                     They fight.
                                                     They fight.
    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
                                                   [They fight.]
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Good night.
    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
  Mother. Good night.
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And makes himself an artificial night.
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    And never from this palace of dim night
  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    'Tis now near night.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    fairly last night.
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Came he not home to-night?
  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
    hand Of yonder knight?
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    It rains downright.
    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.
    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.
    good to hear it.
  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
  Ben. Romeo will answer it.
  Cap. Young Romeo is it?
  Friar. Who is it?
    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;

  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,

  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
    Take it in what sense thou wilt.
    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
  Friar. Go with me to the vault.
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
    And where the worser is predominant,
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
                Is very good meat in Lent;
    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    Piteous predicament!
    Examine every married lineament,
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
    Here in my house do him disparagement.
  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!

    None but for some, and yet all different.
  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
    And see how one another lends content;
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint

  Samp. Fear me not.
    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.

  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
    For here we need it not.
    Uneven is the course; I like it not.
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.

  Nurse. I know not.
    That I yet know not?

    Which the commission of thy years and art
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;

    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    My will to her consent is but a part.
    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
    Your looks are pale and wild and do import
    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
    fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
  Mer. I am hurt.
  Ben. What, art thou hurt?
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
    The unreasonable fury of a beast.
    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
    This night you shall behold him at our feast.
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?
    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
  Rom. I thought all for the best.
  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
    That calls our person from our morning rest?
    Will I set up my everlasting rest
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    The County Paris hath set up his rest
    I'll to my rest.
  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
    Spare not for cost.
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
  Nurse. There's no trust,
  Rom. Out-
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
    ears ere it be out.
  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    sirrah, trudge about
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    To see now how a jest shall come about!
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
    She could have run and waddled all about;
  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
  Friar. That's a certain text.
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
    you.
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
    And presently took post to tell it you.
  Rom. I will follow you.
    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
    Unto the rigour of severest law.
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
                     Enter Juliet above at a window.
  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    What is there? Now, fellow,
  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
    'An if a man did need a poison now
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
    We would as willingly give cure as know.
    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
    O son, the night before thy wedding day
  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
    O woful day! O woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day
  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
    Make haste, I say.
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
  Rom. 'Tis the way
  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
    For this time all the rest depart away.
    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
  Rom. What shall I swear by?
    That we may call it early by-and-by.
  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
    [sings] lady, lady, lady.
    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
    Evermore show'ring? In one little body
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
    Or shall we on without apology?
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
  Friar. O woeful sympathy!
  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
    wisely.
  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
  An old Man, of the Capulet family.
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    The only son of your great enemy.
  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
    Staying for thine to keep him company.
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
    I promise you, but for your company,
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
                                                    Whistle Boy.
  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
    Which to the high topgallant of my joy
    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
  An Apothecary.
                        Enter Apothecary.
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
    I do remember an apothecary,
    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
    And all things change them to the contrary.
  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
    We cannot without circumstance descry.
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    was this that was so full of his ropery?
  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    But O, it presses to my memory
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

    May be put from her by society.

    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    But Romeo may not. More validity,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.
    And I am proof against their enmity.
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Away to heaven respective lenity,

    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,

    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
    I think it best you married with the County.
    On Thursday next be married to this County.
    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
    His son is thirty.
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
    Farewell, my coz.

  Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

ACT I. Scene I.
Verona. A public place.

Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
of Capulet.


  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.

  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.

  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.

  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.

  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
    wall.

  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.

  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
    their heads.

  Greg. The heads of the maids?

  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
    Take it in what sense thou wilt.

  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.

  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
    am a pretty piece of flesh.

  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
    Montagues.

           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].


  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.

  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?

  Samp. Fear me not.

  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!

  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.

  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.

  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?

  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.

  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
    thumb, sir.

  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?

  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
    you.

  Abr. No better.

  Samp. Well, sir.

                        Enter Benvolio.


  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
    master's kinsmen.

  Samp. Yes, better, sir.

  Abr. You lie.

  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
                                                     They fight.

  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.

                          Enter Tybalt.


  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.

  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
    Or manage it to part these men with me.

  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.

     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
                          partisans.


  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!

  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.


  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?

  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.


  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.

  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.


  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For this time all the rest depart away.
    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].

  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    So early walking did I see your son.
    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
    I- measuring his affections by my own,
    Which then most sought where most might not be found,
    Being one too many by my weary self-
    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    Away from light steals home my heavy son
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
    And makes himself an artificial night.
    Black and portentous must this humour prove
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him

  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?

  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
    We would as willingly give cure as know.

                       Enter Romeo.


  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].

  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.

  Rom. Is the day so young?

  Ben. But new struck nine.

  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?

  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.

  Ben. In love?

  Rom. Out-

  Ben. Of love?

  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.

  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    O anything, of nothing first create!
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    Dost thou not laugh?

  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.

  Rom. Good heart, at what?

  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.

  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    Farewell, my coz.

  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?

  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?

  Ben. Groan? Why, no;
    But sadly tell me who.

  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.

  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.

  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    To merit bliss by making me despair.
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.

  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!

  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
    Examine other beauties.

  Rom. 'Tis the way
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.




Scene II.
A Street.

Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.


  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.

  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.

  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
    My will to her consent is but a part.
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well apparell'd April on the heel
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
    sirrah, trudge about
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].

  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!

                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.


  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.

  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

  Ben. For what, I pray thee?

  Rom. For your broken shin.

  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.

  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
    you read anything you see?

  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.

  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!

  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.

      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
      Lucio and the lively Helena.'

    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
    come?

  Serv. Up.

  Rom. Whither?

  Serv. To supper, to our house.

  Rom. Whose house?

  Serv. My master's.

  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.

  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.

  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
    With all the admired beauties of Verona.
    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.

  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]




Scene III.
Capulet's house.

Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.


  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.

  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

                         Enter Juliet.


  Jul. How now? Who calls?

  Nurse. Your mother.

  Jul. Madam, I am here.
    What is your will?

  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

  Wife. She's not fourteen.

  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    To Lammastide?

  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.

  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
    To bid me trudge.
    And since that time it is eleven years,
    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
    She could have run and waddled all about;
    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
    'A was a merry man) took up the child.
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
    To see now how a jest shall come about!
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'

  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.

  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'

  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.

  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    How stands your disposition to be married?

  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.

  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Are made already mothers. By my count,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.

  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.

  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
    This night you shall behold him at our feast.
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Examine every married lineament,
    And see how one another lends content;
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    For fair without the fair within to hide.
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    By having him making yourself no less.

  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men

  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

                        Enter Servingman.


  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
    follow straight.

  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
    Juliet, the County stays.

  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
A street.

Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
Torchbearers.


  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Or shall we on without apology?

  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    After the prompter, for our entrance;
    But, let them measure us by what they will,
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
    And soar with them above a common bound.

  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.

  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.

  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.

  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Give me a case to put my visage in.
    A visor for a visor! What care I
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
    But every man betake him to his legs.

  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

  Rom. Nay, that's not so.

  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
    But 'tis no wit to go.

  Mer. Why, may one ask?

  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.

  Mer. And so did I.

  Rom. Well, what was yours?

  Mer. That dreamers often lie.

  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Then dreams he of another benefice.
    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    Making them women of good carriage.
    This is she-

  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Thou talk'st of nothing.

  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
    Which is as thin of substance as the air,
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    Even now the frozen bosom of the North
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.

  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    But he that hath the steerage of my course
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!

  Ben. Strike, drum.
                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]




Scene V.
Capulet's house.

Servingmen come forth with napkins.

  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
Nell.
    Anthony, and Potpan!
  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
    sought for, in the great chamber.
  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.

    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.


  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
                                    Music plays, and they dance.
    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
    For you and I are past our dancing days.
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    Were in a mask?
  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.

  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
  2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
    His son is thirty.

  Cap. Will you tell me that?
    His son was but a ward two years ago.

  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
    hand Of yonder knight?

  Serv. I know not, sir.

  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?

  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
    A villain, that is hither come in spite
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.

  Cap. Young Romeo is it?

  Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
    I would not for the wealth of all this town
    Here in my house do him disparagement.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
    I'll not endure him.

  Cap. He shall be endur'd.
    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

  Cap. Go to, go to!
    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!

  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.

  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.

  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]

  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]

  Jul. You kiss by th' book.

  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

  Rom. What is her mother?

  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
    Her mother is the lady of the house.
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    Shall have the chinks.

  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
    I'll to my rest.
                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].

  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.

  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?

  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

  Nurse. I know not.

  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
    The only son of your great enemy.

  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    That I must love a loathed enemy.

  Nurse. What's this? what's this?

  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
    Of one I danc'd withal.
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'

  Nurse. Anon, anon!
    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.




PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus.


  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
Exit.




ACT II. Scene I.
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

Enter Romeo alone.


  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]

                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.


  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!

  Mer. He is wise,
    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.

  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
    Call, good Mercutio.

  Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
    That were some spite; my invocation
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
    I conjure only but to raise up him.

  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
    Come, shall we go?

  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
    'To seek him here that means not to be found.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Romeo.


  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

                     Enter Juliet above at a window.

    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    O that she knew she were!
    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!

  Jul. Ay me!

  Rom. She speaks.
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.

  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    Take all myself.

  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
    So stumblest on my counsel?

  Rom. By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Because it is an enemy to thee.
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.

  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.

  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
    And I am proof against their enmity.

  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.

  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    My life were better ended by their hate
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.

  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.

  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-

  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

  Rom. What shall I swear by?

  Jul. Do not swear at all;
    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    And I'll believe thee.

  Rom. If my heart's dear love-

  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
    And yet I would it were to give again.

  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
                                           [Nurse] calls within.
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]

  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

                       Enter Juliet above.


  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

  Nurse. (within) Madam!

  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
    I do beseech thee-

  Nurse. (within) Madam!

  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
    To-morrow will I send.

  Rom. So thrive my soul-

  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.

  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.

                     Enter Juliet again, [above].


  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
    Romeo!

  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!

  Jul. Romeo!

  Rom. My dear?

  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
    Shall I send to thee?

  Rom. By the hour of nine.

  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.

  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.

  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.

  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Forgetting any other home but this.

  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.

  Rom. I would I were thy bird.

  Jul. Sweet, so would I.
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
                                                         [Exit.]

  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
 Exit




Scene III.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.


  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    We sucking on her natural bosom find;
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    None but for some, and yet all different.
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give;
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
    Within the infant rind of this small flower
    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    And where the worser is predominant,
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

                        Enter Romeo.


  Rom. Good morrow, father.

  Friar. Benedicite!
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    Young son, it argues a distempered head
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?

  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies.
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.

  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.

  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.

  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.

  Friar. Not in a grave
    To lay one in, another out to have.

  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    The other did not so.

  Friar. O, she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    But come, young waverer, come go with me.
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.

  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
A street.

Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.


  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Came he not home to-night?

  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.

  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.

  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

  Mer. A challenge, on my life.

  Ben. Romeo will answer it.

  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.

  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
    being dared.

  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?

  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.

  Ben. The what?

  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
    bench? O, their bones, their bones!

                               Enter Romeo.


  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!

  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
    fairly last night.

  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?

  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

  Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
    man to bow in the hams.

  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.

  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.

  Rom. A most courteous exposition.

  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

  Rom. Pink for flower.

  Mer. Right.

  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.

  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.

  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!

  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.

  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.

  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
    there for the goose.

  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!

  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.

  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?

  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
    narrow to an ell broad!

  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
    a hole.

  Ben. Stop there, stop there!

  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

  Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
    occupy the argument no longer.

  Rom. Here's goodly gear!

                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].


  Mer. A sail, a sail!

  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.

  Nurse. Peter!

  Peter. Anon.

  Nurse. My fan, Peter.

  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
    the two.

  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.

  Nurse. Is it good-den?

  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
    now upon the prick of noon.

  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!

  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.

  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
    quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
    young Romeo?

  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
    of that name, for fault of a worse.

  Nurse. You say well.

  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
    wisely.

  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.

  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

  Rom. What hast thou found?

  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
    something stale and hoar ere it be spent
                                     He walks by them and sings.

                   An old hare hoar,
                   And an old hare hoar,
                Is very good meat in Lent;
                   But a hare that is hoar
                   Is too much for a score
                When it hoars ere it be spent.

    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.

  Rom. I will follow you.

  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
    [sings] lady, lady, lady.
                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.

  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
    was this that was so full of his ropery?

  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
'a
    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!

  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
    law on my side.

  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
    thee-

  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.

  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.

  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

  Rom. Bid her devise
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.

  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.

  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.

  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
    Which to the high topgallant of my joy
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.

  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.

  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
    when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
    with a letter?

  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.

  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
    good to hear it.

  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.

  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!

  Peter. Anon.

  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Juliet.


  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
    Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And his to me,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].

    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
                                                   [Exit Peter.]

  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.

  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!

  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.

  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?

  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
    than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
God.
    What, have you din'd at home?

  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
    What says he of our marriage? What of that?

  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!

  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
    is your mother?

  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    "Where is your mother?"'

  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.

  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?

  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

  Jul. I have.

  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene VI.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.


  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    It is enough I may but call her mine.

  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

                     Enter Juliet.

    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.

  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
    Receive in either by this dear encounter.

  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
                                                       [Exeunt.]




ACT III. Scene I.
A public place.

Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.


  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
    says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?

  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    moved.

  Ben. And what to?

  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
    tutor me from quarrelling!

  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!

                       Enter Tybalt and others.


  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.

  Mer. By my heel, I care not.

  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.

  Mer. And but one word with one of us?
    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
    occasion.

  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving

  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
    fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!

  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
    Either withdraw unto some private place
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.

  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,

                        Enter Romeo.


  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
    Your worship in that sense may call him man.

  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.

  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.

  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?

  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?

  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
That I
    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,

    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
    ears ere it be out.

  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]

  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
                                                   [They fight.]

  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
                                           [with his Followers].

  Mer. I am hurt.
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    Is he gone and hath nothing?

  Ben. What, art thou hurt?

  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
                                                    [Exit Page.]

  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
a
    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.

  Rom. I thought all for the best.

  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
    And soundly too. Your houses!
                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].

  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel

                      Enter Benvolio.


  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
    This but begins the woe others must end.

                       Enter Tybalt.


  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
    Away to heaven respective lenity,
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    Is but a little way above our heads,
    Staying for thine to keep him company.
    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Shalt with him hence.

  Rom. This shall determine that.
                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.

  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!

  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
                                                     Exit Romeo.
                      Enter Citizens.


  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?

  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.

  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.


  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
                     and [others].


  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
    O cousin, cousin!

  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    Cold death aside and with the other sends
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.

  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    The life of Tybalt.

  Prince. And for that offence
    Immediately we do exile him hence.
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Juliet alone.


  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
    As is the night before some festival
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,

                Enter Nurse, with cords.

    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?

  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
                                             [Throws them down.]

  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands

  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?

  Nurse. Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.

  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!

  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    For who is living, if those two are gone?

  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!

  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!

  Nurse. There's no trust,
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    Shame come to Romeo!

  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
    But O, it presses to my memory
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar [Laurence].


  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.

                         Enter Romeo.


  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    That I yet know not?

  Friar. Too familiar
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.

  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?

  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.

  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'

  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    But Romeo may not. More validity,
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
    They are free men, but I am banished.
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.

  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.

  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
                                                 Knock [within].

  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.

  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will

  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
    I come from Lady Juliet.

  Friar. Welcome then.

                       Enter Nurse.


  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case!

  Friar. O woeful sympathy!
    Piteous predicament!

  Nurse. Even so lies she,
    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
    Why should you fall into so deep an O?

  Rom. (rises) Nurse-

  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
    With blood remov'd but little from her own?
    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    And then down falls again.

  Rom. As if that name,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]

  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
    The unreasonable fury of a beast.
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
    Romeo is coming.

  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.

  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!

  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
    And he shall signify from time to time
    Every good hap to you that chances here.
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.

  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
    Farewell.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Capulet's house

Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.


  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    I promise you, but for your company,
    I would have been abed an hour ago.

  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.

  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.

  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
    But, soft! what day is this?

  Par. Monday, my lord.

  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
    Afore me, It is so very very late
    That we may call it early by-and-by.
    Good night.
                                                          Exeunt




Scene V.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.


  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
    I have more care to stay than will to go.
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.

  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.

  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!

                          Enter Nurse.


  Nurse. Madam!

  Jul. Nurse?

  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.

  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
                                                         [Exit.]

  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
                                                  He goeth down.

  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
    For in a minute there are many days.
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!

  Rom. Farewell!
    I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.

  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
Exit.

  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    But send him back.

  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

                       Enter Mother.


  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?

  Jul. Madam, I am not well.

  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
    Which you weep for.

  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

  Jul. What villain, madam?

  Lady. That same villain Romeo.

  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.

  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.

  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?

  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
    And see how he will take it at your hands.

                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.


  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    It rains downright.
    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
    Evermore show'ring? In one little body
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
    Without a sudden calm will overset
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
    Have you delivered to her our decree?

  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!

  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
    You tallow-face!

  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
    Or never after look me in the face.
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    And that we have a curse in having her.
    Out on her, hilding!

  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!

  Nurse. I speak no treason.

  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!

  Nurse. May not one speak?

  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
    For here we need it not.

  Lady. You are too hot.

  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.

  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.

  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
    How shall that faith return again to earth
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
    Some comfort, nurse.

  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    I think it best you married with the County.
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    For it excels your first; or if it did not,
    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
    As living here and you no use of him.

  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?

  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.

  Jul. Amen!

  Nurse. What?

  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
    To make confession and to be absolv'd.

  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.

  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.




ACT IV. Scene I.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.


  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.

  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
    Uneven is the course; I like it not.

  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    To stop the inundation of her tears,
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    May be put from her by society.
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.

  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

                    Enter Juliet.


  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!

  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

  Jul. What must be shall be.

  Friar. That's a certain text.

  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?

  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.

  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.

  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.

  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.

  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
    For it was bad enough before their spite.

  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.

  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.

  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass

  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.

  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!

  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    On Thursday next be married to this County.

  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
    Which craves as desperate an execution
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
    If, rather than to marry County Paris
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.

  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
    And hither shall he come; and he and I
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.

  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
    Farewell, dear father.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Capulet's house.

Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
                        two or three.


  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
                                            [Exit a Servingman.]
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
    lick their fingers.

  Cap. How canst thou try them so?

  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
    with me.

  Cap. Go, begone.
                                                Exit Servingman.
    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.

  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

                        Enter Juliet.


  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?

  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
    Of disobedient opposition
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.

  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
    All our whole city is much bound to him.

  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.

  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.

  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
    'Tis now near night.

  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Juliet's chamber.

Enter Juliet and Nurse.


  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    For I have need of many orisons
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.

                          Enter Mother.


  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?

  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    In this so sudden business.

  Mother. Good night.
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]

  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
    Nurse!- What should she do here?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    Come, vial.
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
                                             Lays down a dagger.
    What if it be a poison which the friar
    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Or, if I live, is it not very like
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Together with the terror of the place-
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    Environed with all these hideous fears,
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.




Scene IV.
Capulet's house.

Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.


  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

                       Enter Old Capulet.


  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
    Spare not for cost.

  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
    For this night's watching.

  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.

  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!


  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.

    What is there? Now, fellow,

  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
      logs.
    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.

  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.

  Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
    The County will be here with music straight,
    For so he said he would.                         Play music.
    I hear him near.
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

                              Enter Nurse.
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.
                                                       [Exeunt.]




Scene V.
Juliet's chamber.

[Enter Nurse.]


  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
    The County Paris hath set up his rest
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]
    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    O weraday that ever I was born!
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

                           Enter Mother.


  Mother. What noise is here?

  Nurse. O lamentable day!

  Mother. What is the matter?

  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!

  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Help, help! Call help.

                            Enter Father.


  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!

  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    Life and these lips have long been separated.
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

  Nurse. O lamentable day!

  Mother. O woful time!

  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.


  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.


  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
    O son, the night before thy wedding day
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.

  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?

  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!

  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    Never was seen so black a day as this.
    O woful day! O woful day!

  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death

  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
    To murther, murther our solemnity?
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
    And with my child my joys are buried!

  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
    And all the better is it for the maid.
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    The most you sought was her promotion,
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
    She's not well married that lives married long,
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
    In all her best array bear her to church;
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

  Cap. All things that we ordained festival
    Turn from their office to black funeral-
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
    And all things change them to the contrary.

  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

                         Enter Peter.


  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',

  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.

  Pet. You will not then?
  1. Mus. No.

  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
  1. Mus. What will you give us?

  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
     minstrel.
  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.

  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
    note me?
  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.

           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
           Then music with her silver sound'-

    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
    What say you, Simon Catling?
  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
  2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.

  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.

  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
    gold for sounding.

           'Then music with her silver sound
             With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.

  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
  2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
    mourners, and stay dinner.
                                                         Exeunt.




ACT V. Scene I.
Mantua. A street.

Enter Romeo.


  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.

    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    For nothing can be ill if she be well.

  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    And presently took post to tell it you.
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.

  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
    Your looks are pale and wild and do import
    Some misadventure.

  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

  Man. No, my good lord.

  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
                                               Exit [Balthasar].
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    I do remember an apothecary,
    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
    'An if a man did need a poison now
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!

                        Enter Apothecary.


  Apoth. Who calls so loud?

  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
    Is death to any he that utters them.

  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.

  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.


  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!

                      Enter Friar Laurence.


  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
    One of our order, to associate me
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    So fearful were they of infection.

  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    Unto my cell.

  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.

  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.




Scene III.
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.

Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].


  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]

  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
                                                    Whistle Boy.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]

       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
                    and a crow of iron.


  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
    In what I farther shall intend to do,
    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.

  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]

  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.

  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    But not another sin upon my head
    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.

  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.

  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
                                                     They fight.

  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]

  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]

  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    What said my man when my betossed soul
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    A lightning before death. O, how may I
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
    And never from this palace of dim night
    Depart again. Here, here will I remain
    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
    Will I set up my everlasting rest
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.

    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.


  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
    It burneth in the Capels' monument.

  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.

  Friar. Who is it?

  Bal. Romeo.

  Friar. How long hath he been there?

  Bal. Full half an hour.

  Friar. Go with me to the vault.

  Bal. I dare not, sir.
    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    If I did stay to look on his intents.

  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.

  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    And that my master slew him.

  Friar. Romeo!
    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
                                                   Juliet rises.

  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    I do remember well where I should be,
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
                                                   Exit [Friar].
    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
    Thy lips are warm!

  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].

                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.


  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.

  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    Who here hath lain this two days buried.
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    We cannot without circumstance descry.

     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].

  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.

  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.

          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.

  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.

  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.

              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].


  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
    That calls our person from our morning rest?

            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].


  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
    With open outcry, toward our monument.

  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?

  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    Warm and new kill'd.

  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
    With instruments upon them fit to open
    These dead men's tombs.

  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!

  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

               Enter Montague [and others].


  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
    To see thy son and heir more early down.

  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
    What further woe conspires against mine age?

  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.

  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
    To press before thy father to a grave?

  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
    And then will I be general of your woes
    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.

  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.

  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    All this I know, and to the marriage
    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    Unto the rigour of severest law.

  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?

  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    To this same place, to this same monument.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
    If I departed not and left him there.

  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
    And then I ran away to call the watch.

  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.

  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    Can I demand.

  Mon. But I can give thee more;
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
    That whiles Verona by that name is known,
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
    For never was a story of more woe
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
                                                   Exeunt omnes.

THE END

    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
    A greater power than we can contradict
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
    A lightning before death. O, how may I
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A public place.

    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
    Afore me, It is so very very late
    After the prompter, for our entrance;
    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name

    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,

    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
    All our whole city is much bound to him.
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    All this I know, and to the marriage
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]

    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    'An if a man did need a poison now

    And I am proof against their enmity.
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
    And I'll believe thee.
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And all the better is it for the maid.
    And all things change them to the contrary.
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit

    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
    And he shall signify from time to time
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge

    And hither shall he come; and he and I
    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    And makes himself an artificial night.
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    And never from this palace of dim night
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.
    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
    And presently took post to tell it you.
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
    And see how he will take it at your hands.
    And see how one another lends content;
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    And since that time it is eleven years,
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    And soar with them above a common bound.
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    And soundly too. Your houses!
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    And that my master slew him.
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
    And that we have a curse in having her.
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
    And then I ran away to call the watch.
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    And then down falls again.
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    And then will I be general of your woes
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
    And thou art wedded to calamity.
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
    And where the worser is predominant,
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    And with my child my joys are buried!
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
    And yet I would it were to give again.
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    Anthony, and Potpan!
  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
  Apoth. Who calls so loud?
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Are made already mothers. By my count,
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
    As is the night before some festival
    As living here and you no use of him.
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Attendants.
    Away from light steals home my heavy son
    Away to heaven respective lenity,
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
  Bal. Full half an hour.
  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
  Bal. I dare not, sir.
  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
  Bal. Romeo.
  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
  Balthasar, servant to Romeo.
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    Because it is an enemy to thee.
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
    Being one too many by my weary self-
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
  Ben. And what to?
  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
  Ben. But new struck nine.
  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
  Ben. For what, I pray thee?
  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
  Ben. Groan? Why, no;
  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
  Ben. In love?
  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
  Ben. Of love?
  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
  Ben. Romeo will answer it.
  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
  Ben. Stop there, stop there!
  Ben. Strike, drum.
  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
  Ben. The what?
  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
  Ben. What, art thou hurt?
  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?

    Black and portentous must this humour prove

    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
    But 'tis no wit to go.
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    But O, it presses to my memory
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    But Romeo may not. More validity,
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
                   But a hare that is hoar
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,

    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    But not another sin upon my head
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    But sadly tell me who.
    But send him back.
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
    But to himself so secret and so close,

    By having him making yourself no less.
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,

    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!

    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
    Depart again. Here, here will I remain
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    Dost thou not laugh?
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!

    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    For I have need of many orisons
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    For fair without the fair within to hide.
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    For here we need it not.
    For in a minute there are many days.
    For it excels your first; or if it did not,
    For it was bad enough before their spite.
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    For never was a story of more woe
    For nothing can be ill if she be well.
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    For so he said he would.                         Play music.
    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    For this night's watching.
    For this time all the rest depart away.
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]

  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
  Friar. That's a certain text.
  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
  Friar. Too familiar
  Friar. Welcome then.
  Friar. Who is it?
  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,

    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
    Give me a case to put my visage in.
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.

    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,

    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;

    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the

  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
  Gregory, servant to Capulet.
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
    Have you delivered to her our decree?
    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
                                                  He goeth down.
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
                                     He walks by them and sings.
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
    Help, help! Call help.
    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
    Her mother is the lady of the house.
    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Here in my house do him disparagement.
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
    His son is thirty.
    His son was but a ward two years ago.
    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    How shall that faith return again to earth
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    How stands your disposition to be married?
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
    I come from Lady Juliet.
    I conjure only but to raise up him.
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
    I do beseech thee-
    I do remember an apothecary,
    I do remember well where I should be,
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
    I have more care to stay than will to go.
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
    I hear him near.
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    I promise you, but for your company,
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
    I think it best you married with the County.
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
    I will omit no opportunity
    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
    I would adventure for such merchandise.
    I would have been abed an hour ago.
    I would not for the wealth of all this town
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!
    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
    I'll not endure him.
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
    I'll to my rest.
    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
    I- measuring his affections by my own,
    If I departed not and left him there.
    If I did stay to look on his intents.
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
    If, rather than to marry County Paris
    Immediately we do exile him hence.
    In all her best array bear her to church;
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    In such a gorgeous palace!
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    In this so sudden business.
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    In what I farther shall intend to do,
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    Is but a little way above our heads,
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
    Is death to any he that utters them.
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
    Is he gone and hath nothing?
    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
                   Is too much for a score
                Is very good meat in Lent;
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    It burneth in the Capels' monument.
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    It rains downright.
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
  Jul. Amen!
  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
  Jul. Ay me!
  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  Jul. Do not swear at all;
  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
  Jul. How now? Who calls?
  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
  Jul. I have.
  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Jul. Madam, I am here.
  Jul. Madam, I am not well.
  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
  Jul. Nurse?
  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
  Jul. Romeo!
  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
  Jul. Sweet, so would I.
  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
  Jul. What must be shall be.
  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
  Jul. What villain, madam?
  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
  Jul. You kiss by th' book.
  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
                                                   Juliet rises.
Juliet's chamber.
Juliet's chamber.
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
  Juliet, daughter to Capulet.
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
    Juliet, the County stays.
    Just in her case!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
                                                 Knock [within].
  Lady Capulet, wife to Capulet.
  Lady Montague, wife to Montague.
  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
  Lady. That same villain Romeo.
  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
  Lady. You are too hot.
  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
                                             Lays down a dagger.
                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    Life and these lips have long been separated.
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    Like softest music to attending ears!
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
      Lucio and the lively Helena.'
  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    Making them women of good carriage.
  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
  Man. No, my good lord.

    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    Most lamentable day, most woful day
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
  Mother. Good night.
  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
  Mother. O woful time!
  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
  Mother. What is the matter?
  Mother. What noise is here?
  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'

    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
    My life were better ended by their hate
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
    My will to her consent is but a part.
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Nell.
    Never was seen so black a day as this.
    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
    None but for some, and yet all different.
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
  Nurse to Juliet.
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
    Nurse!- What should she do here?
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
  Nurse. Anon, anon!
  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
  Nurse. Even so lies she,
  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
  Nurse. I know not.
  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
  Nurse. I speak no treason.
  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
  Nurse. Is it good-den?
  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
  Nurse. Madam!
  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
  Nurse. May not one speak?
  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
  Nurse. My fan, Peter.
  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
  Nurse. Peter!
  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
  Nurse. Romeo can,
  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
  Nurse. There's no trust,
  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
  Nurse. What's this? what's this?
  Nurse. What?
  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
  Nurse. You say well.
  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
  Nurse. Your mother.
  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
                                           [Nurse] calls within.
    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    O anything, of nothing first create!
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
    O cousin, cousin!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    O son, the night before thy wedding day
    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    O that she knew she were!
    O weraday that ever I was born!
    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
    O woful day! O woful day!
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
    Of disobedient opposition
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    Of one I danc'd withal.
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    On Thursday next be married to this County.
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    One of our order, to associate me
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    One that you love.
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Or manage it to part these men with me.
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Or never after look me in the face.
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass
    Or shall we on without apology?
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
    Or, if I live, is it not very like
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
    Out on her, hilding!
    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!

    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
  Rom. 'Tis the way
  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
  Rom. (rises) Nurse-
  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
  Rom. A most courteous exposition.
  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
  Rom. As if that name,
  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
  Rom. Bid her devise
  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
  Rom. By a name
  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
  Rom. By the hour of nine.
  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
  Rom. Farewell!
  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
  Rom. For your broken shin.
  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
  Rom. Good heart, at what?
  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
  Rom. Good morrow, father.
  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
  Rom. Here's goodly gear!
  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
  Rom. I thought all for the best.
  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
  Rom. I will follow you.
  Rom. I would I were thy bird.
  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
  Rom. If my heart's dear love-
  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
  Rom. Is the day so young?
  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
  Rom. My dear?
  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
  Rom. Nay, that's not so.
  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
  Rom. Out-
  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
  Rom. Pink for flower.
  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
  Rom. She speaks.
  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
  Rom. So thrive my soul-
  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
  Rom. This shall determine that.
  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
  Rom. Well, what was yours?
  Rom. What hast thou found?
  Rom. What is her mother?
  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
  Rom. What shall I swear by?
  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
  Rom. Whither?
  Rom. Whose house?
  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    Romeo is coming.
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
    Romeo!
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
  Romeo, son to Montague.
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
                            SCENE.--Verona; Mantua.
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have

  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
  Samp. Fear me not.
  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my

    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
  Serv. I know not, sir.
  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own

Servingmen come forth with napkins.
    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
    Shall I send to thee?
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
    Shall have the chinks.
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
    Shalt with him hence.
    Shame come to Romeo!
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
    She could have run and waddled all about;
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    She's not well married that lives married long,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    So early walking did I see your son.
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    So fearful were they of infection.
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
    So stumblest on my counsel?
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
    Some comfort, nurse.
    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    Some misadventure.
    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    Spare not for cost.
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
    Staying for thine to keep him company.
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
THE END
THE END
                        THE PROLOGUE
    Take all myself.
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    Take it in what sense thou wilt.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    That God had lent us but this only child;
That I
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    That I might touch that cheek!
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    That I yet know not?
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
    That all the world will be in love with night
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    That calls our person from our morning rest?
    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
    That we may call it early by-and-by.
    That were some spite; my invocation
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    That whiles Verona by that name is known,
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
    The County Paris hath set up his rest
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    The County will be here with music straight,
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
    The life of Tybalt.
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    The most you sought was her promotion,
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    The only son of your great enemy.
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    The other did not so.
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
    The unreasonable fury of a beast.
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
    Then dreams he of another benefice.
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
           'Then music with her silver sound
           Then music with her silver sound'-
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
    These dead men's tombs.
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    They are free men, but I am banished.
                                                     They fight.
                                                     They fight.
                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.
                                                   [They fight.]
    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]
    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    This but begins the woe others must end.
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
    This is she-
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    This night you shall behold him at our feast.
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    Thou talk'st of nothing.
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  Three Musicians.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
                                             [Throws them down.]
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    Thy lips are warm!
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    'Tis now near night.
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
    To Lammastide?
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
    To bid me trudge.
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
    To lay one in, another out to have.
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    To make confession and to be absolv'd.
    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    To merit bliss by making me despair.
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    To murther, murther our solemnity?
    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
    To press before thy father to a grave?
    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    To see now how a jest shall come about!
    To see thy son and heir more early down.
    'To seek him here that means not to be found.
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
    To stop the inundation of her tears,
    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
    To this same place, to this same monument.
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    To-morrow will I send.
    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
    Together with the terror of the place-
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Torchbearers.
    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
    Turn from their office to black funeral-
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.

  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies

    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,

    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both

    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,

    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Unto my cell.
    Unto the rigour of severest law.
    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
Verona. A public place.
Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    Warm and new kill'd.

    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    We cannot without circumstance descry.
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
    We sucking on her natural bosom find;
    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
    We would as willingly give cure as know.
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Were in a mask?
    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    What further woe conspires against mine age?
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    What if it be a poison which the friar
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
    What is there? Now, fellow,
    What is your will?
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    What said my man when my betossed soul
    What say you, Simon Catling?
    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
    What says he of our marriage? What of that?
    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
    What, have you din'd at home?
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
                When it hoars ere it be spent.
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    When well apparell'd April on the heel
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
    "Where is your mother?"'
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Which craves as desperate an execution
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
    Which is as thin of substance as the air,
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
    Which then most sought where most might not be found,
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
    Which to the high topgallant of my joy
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
    Which you weep for.
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.

    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    Who here hath lain this two days buried.
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Why should you fall into so deep an O?
    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
  Wife. She's not fourteen.
  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
    Will I set up my everlasting rest
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
    With all the admired beauties of Verona.
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
    With blood remov'd but little from her own?
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
    With instruments upon them fit to open
    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
    With open outcry, toward our monument.
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
             With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.

    With all the admired beauties of Verona.
                            SCENE.--Verona; Mantua.
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    For so he said he would.                         Play music.
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Warm and new kill'd.
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
  Cap. He shall be endur'd.
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
    To make confession and to be absolv'd.
  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    Young son, it argues a distempered head
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
    But not another sin upon my head
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
    narrow to an ell broad!
  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    They are free men, but I am banished.
  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
    How stands your disposition to be married?
    And with my child my joys are buried!
    Who here hath lain this two days buried.
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    being dared.
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
    Life and these lips have long been separated.
  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
    moved.
  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    And all the better is it for the maid.
    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    'A was a merry man) took up the child.
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
    Maskers, Torchbearers, Pages, Guards, Watchmen, Servants, and
    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    Can I demand.
  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
    This but begins the woe others must end.
  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
    To-morrow will I send.
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    We sucking on her natural bosom find;
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    And soar with them above a common bound.
    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
    'To seek him here that means not to be found.
    Which then most sought where most might not be found,
  Rom. What hast thou found?
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
           Then music with her silver sound'-
           'Then music with her silver sound
    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
God.
    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
Capulet's orchard.
Capulet's orchard.
Capulet's orchard.
Capulet's orchard.
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
  Rom. I would I were thy bird.
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
  Man. No, my good lord.
    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
  Par. Monday, my lord.
  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
  Apoth. Who calls so loud?
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
Dramatis Personae
    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
    I do remember well where I should be,
  Jul. What must be shall be.
    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    Or never after look me in the face.
  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
    You tallow-face!
    In such a gorgeous palace!
A public place.
Verona. A public place.
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Together with the terror of the place-
    Either withdraw unto some private place
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    Then dreams he of another benefice.
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
                                    Music plays, and they dance.
    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
    After the prompter, for our entrance;
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
  Prince. And for that offence
    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    Immediately we do exile him hence.
    Shalt with him hence.
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
                      Enter Friar Laurence.
Enter Friar [Laurence].
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
  Paris, a young Count, kinsman to the Prince.
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
    For fair without the fair within to hide.
  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    law on my side.
  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
    To Lammastide?
    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
    thee-
  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
    And I'll believe thee.
  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    I do beseech thee-
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
    Shall I send to thee?
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Because it is an enemy to thee.
  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
  Ben. For what, I pray thee?
    Have you delivered to her our decree?
                        two or three.
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
    you read anything you see?
                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
  Mer. A challenge, on my life.
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
    What further woe conspires against mine age?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage

    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
    To bid me trudge.
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,

  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she

    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the

    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
    And the rank poison of the old will die.
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
  Mer. That dreamers often lie.
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
  Abr. You lie.
  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    Or, if I live, is it not very like
  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
    a hole.
  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    One of our order, to associate me
    note me?
  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    with me.
    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
    Or manage it to part these men with me.
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
    But come, young waverer, come go with me.
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    And his to me,
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
  Jul. Ay me!
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
  Rom. By a name
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
  Rom. As if that name,
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
  Mother. O woful time!
    And he shall signify from time to time
  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
    come?
  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    What, have you din'd at home?
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
  Rom. By the hour of nine.
  Ben. But new struck nine.
    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
    For who is living, if those two are gone?
    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
  Cap. Go, begone.
  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
Enter Romeo alone.
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Enter Juliet alone.
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
    For never was a story of more woe
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
  Jul. Madam, I am here.
  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
    Nurse!- What should she do here?
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Every good hap to you that chances here.
  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
  Mother. What noise is here?
  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
    If I departed not and left him there.
  Friar. How long hath he been there?
  Ben. Stop there, stop there!
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    O that she knew she were!
    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
                   Is too much for a score
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
  Mon. But I can give thee more;
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    Some misadventure.
  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case!
    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.
  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
  Rom. Bid her devise
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
  Mer. He is wise,
    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
    there for the goose.
    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    of that name, for fault of a worse.
  Rom. (rises) Nurse-
  Jul. Nurse?
Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
Enter Juliet and Nurse.
                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.
                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
                       Enter Nurse.
                          Enter Nurse.
                              Enter Nurse.
[Enter Nurse.]
    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
    Some comfort, nurse.
  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
  Peter, servant to Juliet's nurse.
  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
    But he that hath the steerage of my course
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    As I remember, this should be the house.
Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
    Her mother is the lady of the house.
  Rom. Whose house?
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
  Serv. To supper, to our house.
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Capulet's house.
Capulet's house.
Capulet's house.
Capulet's house
Capulet's house.
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    O anything, of nothing first create!
  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    My life were better ended by their hate
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
    Afore me, It is so very very late
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
  Friar. Benedicite!
  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    A villain, that is hither come in spite
    For it was bad enough before their spite.
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
  Lady Montague, wife to Montague.
  Romeo, son to Montague.
  Abram, servant to Montague.
  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
  Jul. I have.
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
    To lay one in, another out to have.
  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
  Friar. Not in a grave
    To press before thy father to a grave?
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
    But to the earth some special good doth give;
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
                       Enter Juliet above.
                     Enter Juliet again, [above].
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
  Ben. Of love?
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
  Ben. In love?
  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
  Rom. If my heart's dear love-
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    One that you love.
  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
    Black and portentous must this humour prove
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Being one too many by my weary self-
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
    Take all myself.
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    Out on her, hilding!
    gold for sounding.
    For this night's watching.
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
    Thou talk'st of nothing.
    Is he gone and hath nothing?
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
    tutor me from quarrelling!
    What say you, Simon Catling?
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
    Romeo is coming.
    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
    She's not well married that lives married long,
  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    But she's best married that dies married young.
  Rom. Is the day so young?
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
    In all her best array bear her to church;
                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
    And then I ran away to call the watch.
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    But now I see this one is one too much,
  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Dost thou not laugh?
  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
    am a pretty piece of flesh.
    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath

    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.

    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    How shall that faith return again to earth
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
    Even now the frozen bosom of the North
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
  Nurse. May not one speak?
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
    But send him back.
    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
    That I might touch that cheek!
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
  Jul. You kiss by th' book.
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
  Mer. Why, may one ask?
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    Were in a mask?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Of one I danc'd withal.
    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
    Come, vial.
    Turn from their office to black funeral-
  Cap. All things that we ordained festival
    As is the night before some festival
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
    When well apparell'd April on the heel
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.

    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
    So stumblest on my counsel?
  Mer. A sail, a sail!
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
  Jul. Do not swear at all;
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.

  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Nell.
  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Friar Laurence's cell.
Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
    Unto my cell.
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
    For nothing can be ill if she be well.
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
  Jul. Madam, I am not well.
  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
  Friar. O, she knew well
  Nurse. You say well.
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    Farewell.
  Rom. Farewell!
  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
    What is your will?
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
    But, let them measure us by what they will,
  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
    What said my man when my betossed soul
  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
  Rom. So thrive my soul-
    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. (within) Madam!
  Nurse. Madam!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
  Jul. What villain, madam?
    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Is death to any he that utters them.
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
    I'll not endure him.
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
    As living here and you no use of him.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
    All our whole city is much bound to him.
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    I conjure only but to raise up him.
  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    And that my master slew him.
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
    Thy lips are warm!
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
  Ben. Strike, drum.
  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can

  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can

    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
    Your worship in that sense may call him man.
    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,

  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    Anthony, and Potpan!
  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
  Nurse. Is it good-den?
    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
  Wife. She's not fourteen.
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
  Friar. Welcome then.
  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
  Pet. You will not then?
    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
  Jul. Amen!
  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
    master's kinsmen.
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;

    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven

  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
    And yet I would it were to give again.
    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
    And then down falls again.
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
    Depart again. Here, here will I remain

  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
  Rom. For your broken shin.
  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.

    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    O cousin, cousin!
  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?

    So fearful were they of infection.
    Of disobedient opposition

    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.

  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    So early walking did I see your son.
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    Away from light steals home my heavy son
  Nurse. I speak no treason.
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person

    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
    With blood remov'd but little from her own?
  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own

    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
  Cap. How canst thou try them so?
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    The other did not so.
    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
  Rom. Nay, that's not so.

  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.

    the two.
    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
  Serv. Up.

    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    Help, help! Call help.
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!

    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
  Rom. My dear?

    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,

    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.

    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
  Bal. Full half an hour.
  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
  Serv. My master's.
  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
    These dead men's tombs.
    their heads.
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
    Is but a little way above our heads,
  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
  Greg. The heads of the maids?
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And see how he will take it at your hands.
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Cold death aside and with the other sends
  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
                Enter Nurse, with cords.
  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies.
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    Examine other beauties.
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
                                  Exeunt omnes.
                                                   Exeunt omnes.
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    bench? O, their bones, their bones!
    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
    And then will I be general of your woes
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
                                                   Juliet rises.
    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
  Citizens of Verona; Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of both houses;
    And soundly too. Your houses!
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Montagues.
  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
    But every man betake him to his legs.
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
                                     He walks by them and sings.
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
      logs.
  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
  Nurse. What's this? what's this?
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
    Never was seen so black a day as this.
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
    But, soft! what day is this?
  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
    Forgetting any other home but this.
  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    If, rather than to marry County Paris
  Rom. She speaks.
    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    Shall have the chinks.
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
  Jul. How now? Who calls?
                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]
                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.
  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
    man to bow in the hams.
    But, as it seems
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
  Three Musicians.
  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
                          partisans.
                      Enter Citizens.
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]
        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
Servingmen come forth with napkins.
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    For I have need of many orisons
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Like softest music to attending ears!
  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Environed with all these hideous fears,
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
    To stop the inundation of her tears,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
    And since that time it is eleven years,
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    lick their fingers.
                       Enter Tybalt and others.
               Enter Montague [and others].
            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
                     and [others].
  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Torchbearers.
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
                                           [with his Followers].
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
  Rom. Well, what was yours?
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    By having him making yourself no less.
  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
    In this so sudden business.
    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    Attendants.
              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
    If I did stay to look on his intents.
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  1. Mus. What will you give us?
  Mer. And but one word with one of us?
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
  Chorus.
Enter Chorus.
                        Enter Chorus.
  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
    For you and I are past our dancing days.
    For in a minute there are many days.
  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
    Juliet, the County stays.
  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
  Nurse. What?
  Cap. Will you tell me that?
  Rom. This shall determine that.
    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
    What says he of our marriage? What of that?
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
  Ben. The what?
  Rom. Good heart, at what?
  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A Street.
A street.
A street.
Mantua. A street.
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,

    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet

Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
                       Enter Old Capulet.
  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,

  Juliet, daughter to Capulet.

    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
    Without a sudden calm will overset
    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
  Mer. Right.
    The County will be here with music straight,
    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
    follow straight.

    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Good night.
    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
  Mother. Good night.
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And makes himself an artificial night.
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    And never from this palace of dim night
  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    'Tis now near night.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    fairly last night.
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Came he not home to-night?
  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night

    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    It rains downright.
    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.
    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.
    good to hear it.
  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
  Ben. Romeo will answer it.
  Cap. Young Romeo is it?
  Friar. Who is it?
    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,

    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
    And where the worser is predominant,
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,

    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;

    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
    Here in my house do him disparagement.
  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'

    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?
    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.

    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!

  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
    That calls our person from our morning rest?
    Will I set up my everlasting rest
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    The County Paris hath set up his rest
    I'll to my rest.
  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
    Spare not for cost.
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    sirrah, trudge about
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    To see now how a jest shall come about!
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
    She could have run and waddled all about;
  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
  Friar. That's a certain text.
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
    you.
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;

  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
    And presently took post to tell it you.
  Rom. I will follow you.
    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
    Unto the rigour of severest law.
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
                     Enter Juliet above at a window.
  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    What is there? Now, fellow,
  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
    'An if a man did need a poison now
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
    We would as willingly give cure as know.
    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
  Nurse. O lamentable day!
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
    O son, the night before thy wedding day
  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
    O woful day! O woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day
  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
    Make haste, I say.
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
  Rom. 'Tis the way
  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
    For this time all the rest depart away.
    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
  Rom. What shall I swear by?
    That we may call it early by-and-by.
  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
    [sings] lady, lady, lady.
    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
    Evermore show'ring? In one little body
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
    Or shall we on without apology?
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
  Friar. O woeful sympathy!
  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
    wisely.
  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
  An old Man, of the Capulet family.
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    The only son of your great enemy.
  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
    Staying for thine to keep him company.
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
    I promise you, but for your company,
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
                                                    Whistle Boy.
  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
    Which to the high topgallant of my joy
    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
  An Apothecary.
                        Enter Apothecary.
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
    I do remember an apothecary,
    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
    And all things change them to the contrary.
  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
    We cannot without circumstance descry.
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    was this that was so full of his ropery?
  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    But O, it presses to my memory
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    But Romeo may not. More validity,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.
    And I am proof against their enmity.
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,

  Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

ACT I. Scene I.
Verona. A public place.

Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
of Capulet.


  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.

  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.

  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.

  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.

  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
    wall.

  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.

  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
    their heads.

  Greg. The heads of the maids?

  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
    Take it in what sense thou wilt.

  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.

  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
    am a pretty piece of flesh.

  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
    Montagues.

           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].


  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.

  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?

  Samp. Fear me not.

  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!

  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
    disgrace to them, if they bear it.

  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.

  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?

  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.

  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
    thumb, sir.

  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?

  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
    you.

  Abr. No better.

  Samp. Well, sir.

                        Enter Benvolio.


  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
    master's kinsmen.

  Samp. Yes, better, sir.

  Abr. You lie.

  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
                                                     They fight.

  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.

                          Enter Tybalt.


  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.

  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
    Or manage it to part these men with me.

  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.

     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
                          partisans.


  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!

  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.


  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?

  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.


  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.

  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.


  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For this time all the rest depart away.
    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].

  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
    I drew to part them. In the instant came
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    So early walking did I see your son.
    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
    And stole into the covert of the wood.
    I- measuring his affections by my own,
    Which then most sought where most might not be found,
    Being one too many by my weary self-
    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    Away from light steals home my heavy son
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
    And makes himself an artificial night.
    Black and portentous must this humour prove
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him

  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?

  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
    We would as willingly give cure as know.

                       Enter Romeo.


  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].

  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.

  Rom. Is the day so young?

  Ben. But new struck nine.

  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?

  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.

  Ben. In love?

  Rom. Out-

  Ben. Of love?

  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.

  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    O anything, of nothing first create!
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    Dost thou not laugh?

  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.

  Rom. Good heart, at what?

  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.

  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
    Farewell, my coz.

  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?

  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?

  Ben. Groan? Why, no;
    But sadly tell me who.

  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.

  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.

  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    To merit bliss by making me despair.
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.

  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!

  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
    Examine other beauties.

  Rom. 'Tis the way
    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.

  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.




Scene II.
A Street.

Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.


  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.

  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
    Let two more summers wither in their pride
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.

  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
    My will to her consent is but a part.
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well apparell'd April on the heel
    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
    sirrah, trudge about
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].

  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!

                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.


  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.

  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

  Ben. For what, I pray thee?

  Rom. For your broken shin.

  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.

  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
    you read anything you see?

  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.

  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!

  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.

      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
      Lucio and the lively Helena.'

    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
    come?

  Serv. Up.

  Rom. Whither?

  Serv. To supper, to our house.

  Rom. Whose house?

  Serv. My master's.

  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.

  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.

  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
    With all the admired beauties of Verona.
    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.

  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]




Scene III.
Capulet's house.

Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.


  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.

  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

                         Enter Juliet.


  Jul. How now? Who calls?

  Nurse. Your mother.

  Jul. Madam, I am here.
    What is your will?

  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

  Wife. She's not fourteen.

  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    To Lammastide?

  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.

  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
    To bid me trudge.
    And since that time it is eleven years,
    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
    She could have run and waddled all about;
    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
    'A was a merry man) took up the child.
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
    To see now how a jest shall come about!
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'

  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.

  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'

  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.

  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    How stands your disposition to be married?

  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.

  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Are made already mothers. By my count,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.

  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.

  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
    This night you shall behold him at our feast.
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Examine every married lineament,
    And see how one another lends content;
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    For fair without the fair within to hide.
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    By having him making yourself no less.

  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men

  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

                        Enter Servingman.


  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
    follow straight.

  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
    Juliet, the County stays.

  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
A street.

Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
Torchbearers.


  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Or shall we on without apology?

  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    After the prompter, for our entrance;
    But, let them measure us by what they will,
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
    And soar with them above a common bound.

  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.

  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.

  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.

  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Give me a case to put my visage in.
    A visor for a visor! What care I
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
    But every man betake him to his legs.

  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

  Rom. Nay, that's not so.

  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
    But 'tis no wit to go.

  Mer. Why, may one ask?

  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.

  Mer. And so did I.

  Rom. Well, what was yours?

  Mer. That dreamers often lie.

  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
    On the forefinger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
    Not half so big as a round little worm
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
    Then dreams he of another benefice.
    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    That plats the manes of horses in the night
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    Making them women of good carriage.
    This is she-

  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Thou talk'st of nothing.

  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
    Which is as thin of substance as the air,
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    Even now the frozen bosom of the North
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.

  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    But he that hath the steerage of my course
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!

  Ben. Strike, drum.
                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]




Scene V.
Capulet's house.

Servingmen come forth with napkins.

  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
Nell.
    Anthony, and Potpan!
  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
    sought for, in the great chamber.
  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.

    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.


  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
                                    Music plays, and they dance.
    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
    For you and I are past our dancing days.
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    Were in a mask?
  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.

  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
  2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
    His son is thirty.

  Cap. Will you tell me that?
    His son was but a ward two years ago.

  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
    hand Of yonder knight?

  Serv. I know not, sir.

  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?

  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
    A villain, that is hither come in spite
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.

  Cap. Young Romeo is it?

  Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
    I would not for the wealth of all this town
    Here in my house do him disparagement.
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
    I'll not endure him.

  Cap. He shall be endur'd.
    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

  Cap. Go to, go to!
    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!

  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.

  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.

  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]

  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]

  Jul. You kiss by th' book.

  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

  Rom. What is her mother?

  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
    Her mother is the lady of the house.
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    Shall have the chinks.

  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
    I'll to my rest.
                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].

  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.

  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?

  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

  Nurse. I know not.

  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
    The only son of your great enemy.

  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    That I must love a loathed enemy.

  Nurse. What's this? what's this?

  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
    Of one I danc'd withal.
                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'

  Nurse. Anon, anon!
    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.




PROLOGUE

Enter Chorus.


  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
Exit.




ACT II. Scene I.
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

Enter Romeo alone.


  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]

                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.


  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!

  Mer. He is wise,
    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.

  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
    Call, good Mercutio.

  Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
    That were some spite; my invocation
    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
    I conjure only but to raise up him.

  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
    To be consorted with the humorous night.
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
    Come, shall we go?

  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
    'To seek him here that means not to be found.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Romeo.


  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

                     Enter Juliet above at a window.

    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    Who is already sick and pale with grief
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
    O that she knew she were!
    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!

  Jul. Ay me!

  Rom. She speaks.
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.

  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet.
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
    Take all myself.

  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
    So stumblest on my counsel?

  Rom. By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Because it is an enemy to thee.
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.

  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.

  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
    And I am proof against their enmity.

  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.

  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
    My life were better ended by their hate
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.

  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.

  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-

  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

  Rom. What shall I swear by?

  Jul. Do not swear at all;
    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    And I'll believe thee.

  Rom. If my heart's dear love-

  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
    And yet I would it were to give again.

  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
                                           [Nurse] calls within.
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]

  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

                       Enter Juliet above.


  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

  Nurse. (within) Madam!

  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
    I do beseech thee-

  Nurse. (within) Madam!

  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
    To-morrow will I send.

  Rom. So thrive my soul-

  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.

  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.

                     Enter Juliet again, [above].


  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
    Romeo!

  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!

  Jul. Romeo!

  Rom. My dear?

  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
    Shall I send to thee?

  Rom. By the hour of nine.

  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.

  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.

  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.

  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Forgetting any other home but this.

  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.

  Rom. I would I were thy bird.

  Jul. Sweet, so would I.
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
                                                         [Exit.]

  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
 Exit




Scene III.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.


  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    We sucking on her natural bosom find;
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    None but for some, and yet all different.
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give;
    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
    Within the infant rind of this small flower
    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
    And where the worser is predominant,
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

                        Enter Romeo.


  Rom. Good morrow, father.

  Friar. Benedicite!
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    Young son, it argues a distempered head
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.

  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?

  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies.
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.

  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.

  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.

  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.

  Friar. Not in a grave
    To lay one in, another out to have.

  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
    The other did not so.

  Friar. O, she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
    But come, young waverer, come go with me.
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.

  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
A street.

Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.


  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Came he not home to-night?

  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.

  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.

  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

  Mer. A challenge, on my life.

  Ben. Romeo will answer it.

  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.

  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
    being dared.

  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?

  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.

  Ben. The what?

  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
    bench? O, their bones, their bones!

                               Enter Romeo.


  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!

  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
    fairly last night.

  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?

  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

  Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
    man to bow in the hams.

  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.

  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.

  Rom. A most courteous exposition.

  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

  Rom. Pink for flower.

  Mer. Right.

  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.

  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.

  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!

  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.

  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.

  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
    there for the goose.

  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!

  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.

  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?

  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
    narrow to an ell broad!

  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
    a hole.

  Ben. Stop there, stop there!

  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

  Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
    occupy the argument no longer.

  Rom. Here's goodly gear!

                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].


  Mer. A sail, a sail!

  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.

  Nurse. Peter!

  Peter. Anon.

  Nurse. My fan, Peter.

  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
    the two.

  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.

  Nurse. Is it good-den?

  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
    now upon the prick of noon.

  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!

  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.

  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
    quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
    young Romeo?

  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
    of that name, for fault of a worse.

  Nurse. You say well.

  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
    wisely.

  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.

  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

  Rom. What hast thou found?

  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
    something stale and hoar ere it be spent
                                     He walks by them and sings.

                   An old hare hoar,
                   And an old hare hoar,
                Is very good meat in Lent;
                   But a hare that is hoar
                   Is too much for a score
                When it hoars ere it be spent.

    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.

  Rom. I will follow you.

  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
    [sings] lady, lady, lady.
                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.

  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
    was this that was so full of his ropery?

  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
'a
    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!

  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
    law on my side.

  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
    thee-

  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.

  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.

  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

  Rom. Bid her devise
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.

  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.

  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.

  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
    Which to the high topgallant of my joy
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.

  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.

  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
    when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
    with a letter?

  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.

  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
    good to hear it.

  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.

  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!

  Peter. Anon.

  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene V.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Juliet.


  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
    Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And his to me,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].

    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
                                                   [Exit Peter.]

  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.

  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!

  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.

  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?

  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
    than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
God.
    What, have you din'd at home?

  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
    What says he of our marriage? What of that?

  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!

  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
    is your mother?

  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    "Where is your mother?"'

  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.

  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?

  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

  Jul. I have.

  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene VI.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.


  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    It is enough I may but call her mine.

  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

                     Enter Juliet.

    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.

  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
    Receive in either by this dear encounter.

  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
                                                       [Exeunt.]




ACT III. Scene I.
A public place.

Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.


  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
    says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?

  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
    moved.

  Ben. And what to?

  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
    tutor me from quarrelling!

  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!

                       Enter Tybalt and others.


  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.

  Mer. By my heel, I care not.

  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.

  Mer. And but one word with one of us?
    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
    occasion.

  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving

  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
    fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!

  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
    Either withdraw unto some private place
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.

  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,

                        Enter Romeo.


  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.

  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
    Your worship in that sense may call him man.

  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.

  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.

  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?

  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?

  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
That I
    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,

    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
    ears ere it be out.

  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]

  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
                                                   [They fight.]

  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
                                           [with his Followers].

  Mer. I am hurt.
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    Is he gone and hath nothing?

  Ben. What, art thou hurt?

  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
                                                    [Exit Page.]

  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.

  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
a
    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.

  Rom. I thought all for the best.

  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
    And soundly too. Your houses!
                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].

  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel

                      Enter Benvolio.


  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
    This but begins the woe others must end.

                       Enter Tybalt.


  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
    Away to heaven respective lenity,
    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    Is but a little way above our heads,
    Staying for thine to keep him company.
    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Shalt with him hence.

  Rom. This shall determine that.
                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.

  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!

  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
                                                     Exit Romeo.
                      Enter Citizens.


  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?

  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.

  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.


  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
                     and [others].


  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
    O cousin, cousin!

  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    Cold death aside and with the other sends
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.

  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    The life of Tybalt.

  Prince. And for that offence
    Immediately we do exile him hence.
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Juliet alone.


  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
    As is the night before some festival
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,

                Enter Nurse, with cords.

    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?

  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
                                             [Throws them down.]

  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands

  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?

  Nurse. Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.

  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!

  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    For who is living, if those two are gone?

  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!

  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!

  Nurse. There's no trust,
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    Shame come to Romeo!

  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
    But O, it presses to my memory
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar [Laurence].


  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.

                         Enter Romeo.


  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
    That I yet know not?

  Friar. Too familiar
    Is my dear son with such sour company.
    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.

  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?

  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.

  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'

  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    But Romeo may not. More validity,
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
    They are free men, but I am banished.
    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.

  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.

  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
                                                 Knock [within].

  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.

  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will

  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
    I come from Lady Juliet.

  Friar. Welcome then.

                       Enter Nurse.


  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case!

  Friar. O woeful sympathy!
    Piteous predicament!

  Nurse. Even so lies she,
    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
    Why should you fall into so deep an O?

  Rom. (rises) Nurse-

  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
    With blood remov'd but little from her own?
    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    And then down falls again.

  Rom. As if that name,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]

  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
    The unreasonable fury of a beast.
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
    Romeo is coming.

  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.

  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!

  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
    And he shall signify from time to time
    Every good hap to you that chances here.
    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.

  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
    Farewell.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene IV.
Capulet's house

Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.


  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
    I promise you, but for your company,
    I would have been abed an hour ago.

  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.

  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.

  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
    But, soft! what day is this?

  Par. Monday, my lord.

  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
    Afore me, It is so very very late
    That we may call it early by-and-by.
    Good night.
                                                          Exeunt




Scene V.
Capulet's orchard.

Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.


  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
    I have more care to stay than will to go.
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.

  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.

  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!

                          Enter Nurse.


  Nurse. Madam!

  Jul. Nurse?

  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.

  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
                                                         [Exit.]

  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
                                                  He goeth down.

  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
    For in a minute there are many days.
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!

  Rom. Farewell!
    I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.

  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
Exit.

  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
    But send him back.

  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

                       Enter Mother.


  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?

  Jul. Madam, I am not well.

  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
    Which you weep for.

  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

  Jul. What villain, madam?

  Lady. That same villain Romeo.

  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.

  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.

  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?

  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
    And see how he will take it at your hands.

                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.


  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    It rains downright.
    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
    Evermore show'ring? In one little body
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
    Without a sudden calm will overset
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
    Have you delivered to her our decree?

  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!

  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
    You tallow-face!

  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
    Or never after look me in the face.
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    And that we have a curse in having her.
    Out on her, hilding!

  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!

  Nurse. I speak no treason.

  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!

  Nurse. May not one speak?

  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
    For here we need it not.

  Lady. You are too hot.

  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.

  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.

  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
    How shall that faith return again to earth
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
    Some comfort, nurse.

  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    I think it best you married with the County.
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    For it excels your first; or if it did not,
    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
    As living here and you no use of him.

  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?

  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.

  Jul. Amen!

  Nurse. What?

  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
    To make confession and to be absolv'd.

  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.

  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.




ACT IV. Scene I.
Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.


  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.

  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
    Uneven is the course; I like it not.

  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    To stop the inundation of her tears,
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    May be put from her by society.
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.

  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

                    Enter Juliet.


  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!

  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

  Jul. What must be shall be.

  Friar. That's a certain text.

  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?

  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.

  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.

  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.

  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.

  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
    For it was bad enough before their spite.

  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.

  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.

  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass

  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.

  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!

  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    On Thursday next be married to this County.

  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
    Do thou but call my resolution wise
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
    Which craves as desperate an execution
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
    If, rather than to marry County Paris
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.

  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
    And hither shall he come; and he and I
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.

  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
    Farewell, dear father.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Capulet's house.

Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
                        two or three.


  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
                                            [Exit a Servingman.]
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
    lick their fingers.

  Cap. How canst thou try them so?

  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
    with me.

  Cap. Go, begone.
                                                Exit Servingman.
    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.

  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

                        Enter Juliet.


  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?

  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
    Of disobedient opposition
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.

  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
    All our whole city is much bound to him.

  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.

  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.

  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
    'Tis now near night.

  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene III.
Juliet's chamber.

Enter Juliet and Nurse.


  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
    For I have need of many orisons
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.

                          Enter Mother.


  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?

  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    For I am sure you have your hands full all
    In this so sudden business.

  Mother. Good night.
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]

  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
    Nurse!- What should she do here?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    Come, vial.
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
                                             Lays down a dagger.
    What if it be a poison which the friar
    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Or, if I live, is it not very like
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Together with the terror of the place-
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
    Where for this many hundred years the bones
    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    Environed with all these hideous fears,
    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.




Scene IV.
Capulet's house.

Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.


  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

                       Enter Old Capulet.


  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
    Spare not for cost.

  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
    For this night's watching.

  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
    But I will watch you from such watching now.
                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.

  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!


  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.

    What is there? Now, fellow,

  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
      logs.
    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.

  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.

  Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
    The County will be here with music straight,
    For so he said he would.                         Play music.
    I hear him near.
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

                              Enter Nurse.
    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.
                                                       [Exeunt.]




Scene V.
Juliet's chamber.

[Enter Nurse.]


  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
    The County Paris hath set up his rest
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]
    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
    O weraday that ever I was born!
    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

                           Enter Mother.


  Mother. What noise is here?

  Nurse. O lamentable day!

  Mother. What is the matter?

  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!

  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Help, help! Call help.

                            Enter Father.


  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!

  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    Life and these lips have long been separated.
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

  Nurse. O lamentable day!

  Mother. O woful time!

  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.


  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.


  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
    O son, the night before thy wedding day
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.

  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?

  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!

  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day
    That ever ever I did yet behold!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    Never was seen so black a day as this.
    O woful day! O woful day!

  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death

  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
    To murther, murther our solemnity?
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
    And with my child my joys are buried!

  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
    And all the better is it for the maid.
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    The most you sought was her promotion,
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
    She's not well married that lives married long,
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
    In all her best array bear her to church;
    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

  Cap. All things that we ordained festival
    Turn from their office to black funeral-
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
    And all things change them to the contrary.

  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

                         Enter Peter.


  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',

  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.

  Pet. You will not then?
  1. Mus. No.

  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
  1. Mus. What will you give us?

  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
     minstrel.
  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.

  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
    note me?
  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.

           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
           Then music with her silver sound'-

    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
    What say you, Simon Catling?
  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
  2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.

  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.

  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
    gold for sounding.

           'Then music with her silver sound
             With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.

  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
  2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
    mourners, and stay dinner.
                                                         Exeunt.




ACT V. Scene I.
Mantua. A street.

Enter Romeo.


  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.

    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
    For nothing can be ill if she be well.

  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    And presently took post to tell it you.
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.

  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
    Your looks are pale and wild and do import
    Some misadventure.

  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

  Man. No, my good lord.

  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
                                               Exit [Balthasar].
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    I do remember an apothecary,
    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
    'An if a man did need a poison now
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!

                        Enter Apothecary.


  Apoth. Who calls so loud?

  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
    Is death to any he that utters them.

  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.

  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
                                                         Exeunt.




Scene II.
Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.

Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.


  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!

                      Enter Friar Laurence.


  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
    One of our order, to associate me
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    So fearful were they of infection.

  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    Unto my cell.

  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.

  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.




Scene III.
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.

Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].


  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]

  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
                                                    Whistle Boy.
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]

       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
                    and a crow of iron.


  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Why I descend into this bed of death
    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
    In what I farther shall intend to do,
    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.

  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]

  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
                                           Romeo opens the tomb.

  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    But not another sin upon my head
    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.

  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.

  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
                                                     They fight.

  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]

  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]

  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    What said my man when my betossed soul
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    A lightning before death. O, how may I
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    O, what more favour can I do to thee
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
    And never from this palace of dim night
    Depart again. Here, here will I remain
    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
    Will I set up my everlasting rest
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.

    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.


  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
    It burneth in the Capels' monument.

  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.

  Friar. Who is it?

  Bal. Romeo.

  Friar. How long hath he been there?

  Bal. Full half an hour.

  Friar. Go with me to the vault.

  Bal. I dare not, sir.
    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
    And fearfully did menace me with death
    If I did stay to look on his intents.

  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.

  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    And that my master slew him.

  Friar. Romeo!
    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
                                                   Juliet rises.

  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    I do remember well where I should be,
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
                                                   Exit [Friar].
    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
    Thy lips are warm!

  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].

                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.


  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.

  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    Who here hath lain this two days buried.
    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    We cannot without circumstance descry.

     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].

  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.

  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.

          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.

  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
    We took this mattock and this spade from him
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.

  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.

              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].


  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
    That calls our person from our morning rest?

            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].


  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
    With open outcry, toward our monument.

  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?

  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    Warm and new kill'd.

  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
    With instruments upon them fit to open
    These dead men's tombs.

  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague,
    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!

  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

               Enter Montague [and others].


  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
    To see thy son and heir more early down.

  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
    What further woe conspires against mine age?

  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.

  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
    To press before thy father to a grave?

  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
    Till we can clear these ambiguities
    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
    And then will I be general of your woes
    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.

  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.

  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
    That he should hither come as this dire night
    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    At the prefixed hour of her waking
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    All this I know, and to the marriage
    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    Unto the rigour of severest law.

  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?

  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    To this same place, to this same monument.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
    If I departed not and left him there.

  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
    And then I ran away to call the watch.

  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.

  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    Can I demand.

  Mon. But I can give thee more;
    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
    That whiles Verona by that name is known,
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
    For never was a story of more woe
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
                                                   Exeunt omnes.

THE END
                                  Exeunt omnes.
